# EGLDRAW
EGL is an updated image format based off IGL


coming soon.

Holding off on MDRAW2 because i want to incorporate a Sprite Menu and i have not had time to implement.


the scope of this project is for the FABGL ANSI Terminal.
it is an image format that uses the FABGL shape primatives and colors to fast draw pixels, lines, circles, boxes to the terminal screen.

uses include visual information for games, paint and drawing, printer output, GUI creation.

the software package will include. MDRAW2 a mouse driven paint drawing program which allows up to 500 elements to be placed on the screen.
this limit is due to several reasons but can be easy ignored as you can stack EGL files by merging them and allow for more elements.

MDRAW2 is a simple drawing enviroment

EGLDRAW is a sample display program to show how EGL files are displayed and allows for manipulation of Scale, X-Y Transition, and simple reflection and rotation in 90 degree increments.

IGLTOEGL is a simple file converter to take existing IGL And make EGL format.
